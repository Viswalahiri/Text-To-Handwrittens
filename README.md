# Text-To-Handwritten
Handwritten assignments are so boring. All you have to do is writing long pages and that too boring content.
So, To get rid of this boring work, I was thinking to create a software which will ease my work.

Here, is the link of the text to handwritten software.

You all just have to upload a .txt file and then you can successfully download the PDF. Or you can clone the repository, merge or change the letter folder and run on the local server.
This site works better on desktop.
